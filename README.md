# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Daily Data

This repository contains a complete Python Web Scraper which retrieves all the data provided by [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. So on, all the data available from every country is retrieved and transformed into CSV files using a simple Python script.

## Features

- Detailed data from every country available at Worldometer, which is indeed every country affected by the pandemic.
- Data is updated daily so you can track its evolution day by day.

## TODO

- Create a simple Python package so as to let every user retrieve the data they need from Worldometer related to the virus.
- Include real time data on the package so as to let the users keep a real time tracking of the virus such as the website does.
- Retrieve a complete list of all the affected countries as indexed at Worldometer and store their data on separate directories.
- Open call to Data Scientists to use the data and provide daily useful reports which will be included in the README.md or in the Wiki.
- Generate the coronavirus overview as presented at: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/
- Include a "Latest Updates" section on the README which will be updated daily too
- Include some simple stats in the README so as to provide useful information for the Github users that visit this repository
- and much more to come...

### All the data contained in this repository is updated once a day until the Coronavirus pandemic ends
