# Coronavirus (COVID-19) Daily Data

This repository contains a complete Python Web Scraper which retrieves all the data provided by [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. So on, all the data available from every country is retrieved and transformed into CSV files using a simple Python script.

## Features

- Detailed data from every country available at Worldometer, which is indeed every country affected by the pandemic.
- Data is updated daily so you can track its evolution day by day.

## Contribute



## TODO

- Create a simple Python package so as to let every user retrieve the data they need from Worldometer related to the virus.
- Include real time data on the package so as to let the users keep a real time tracking of the virus such as the website does.
- ~~Retrieve a complete list of all the affected countries as indexed at Worldometer and store their data on separate directories.~~
- Open call to Data Scientists to use the data and provide daily useful reports which will be included in the README.md or in the Wiki, will be described in the Contribute Section of the README.
- ~~Generate the coronavirus overview as presented at: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/~~
- Include a "Latest Updates" section on the README which will be updated daily too
- Also so as to provide the data in a more generic way, a simple Flask RESTX API will be created using [restx-cookie](https://github.com/alvarobartt/restx-cookie), after developing the Python package so that the API endpoints will just be calls to the package functions
- Include some simple stats in the README so as to provide useful information for the Github users that visit this repository
- and much more to come...

### All the data contained in this repository is updated once a day until the Coronavirus pandemic ends
