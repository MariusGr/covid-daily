# ðŸ¦  :earth_africa: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Daily Data ðŸ¦  :earth_africa:

This repository contains a complete Python Web Scraper which retrieves all the data provided by [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. So on, all the data available from every country is retrieved and transformed into CSV files using a simple Python script.

## TODO

- Check README.md and explain package usage
- Include real time data on the package so as to let the users keep a real time tracking of the virus such as the website does.
- Include a "Latest Updates" section on the README which will be updated daily too
- Also so as to provide the data in a more generic way, a simple Flask RESTX API will be created using [restx-cookie](https://github.com/alvarobartt/restx-cookie), after developing the Python package so that the API endpoints will just be calls to the package functions
- Include some simple stats in the README so as to provide useful information for the Github users that visit this repository
- and much more to come...

## Features

- Detailed data from every country available at Worldometer, which is indeed every country affected by the pandemic.
- Data is updated daily so you can track its evolution day by day.

## Installation

In order to get this package working you will need to **install it via pip** (with a Python3.5 version or higher) on the terminal by typing:

``$ pip install coronavirus_daily_data``

## Documentation

You can find the **complete developer documentation** at: https://coronavirus_daily_data.readthedocs.io/, hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and generated using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the theme [sphinx_rtd_theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) which is the standard Read the Docs theme for sphinx.

## Usage

So as to use this Python package, a sample piece of code is presented below:

```python
import coronavirus_daily_data

coronavirus_daily_data.overview()
```

So on, the previous piece of code outputs the following line:

```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
